moo-d is an Android app that allows users to post, track, and share their moods.  
Innovative features help users get a better sense of why they feel the way they do.  

## Features
- Track your moods using Mood Events, which contain valuable information about the way you're feeling, such as the time, location and social situation you found yourself in when you were feeling a certain way
- Attach comments and even photographs to your MoodEvents, to paint a better picture of your emotional state
- Follow your friends, so that you can keep track of how those closest to you are feeling
- View your Mood Events (or your friends') on a Mood Map, which allows you to gain a better understanding of how you feel based on your location
